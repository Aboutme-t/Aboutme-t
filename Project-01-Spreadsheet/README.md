## Project overview
In this project, my main job is to use Google Sheets to look at and arrange data. I'll be using functions like VLOOKUP and REGEX to pull out specific information, match data, and manipulate it as needed. The focus is on making data analysis and organization easier by using these Google Sheets functions effectively.
